Each node needs 464 additional halo sites (self halos to be removed).
Allocated memory for lookup tables.
All tests OK! Time taken: 0.000282 seconds.
Initialization done! Took 0.002231 seconds.
Allocated memory for fields.

Loading weightfile: weight
Unable to access weightfile!!
Initialized new weight 
readonly not 0, so multicanonical weight WILL be modified!
